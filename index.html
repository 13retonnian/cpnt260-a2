      <h1>The Healing Power of Natural Environments</h1>
      <p>Natural environments are places where our ancestors spent most of their lives. Forests, fields, beaches and other natural environments are the places where our bodies evolved and could be places where our bodies naturally want to be.</p>
      <p>The sights and sounds of nature have been known to have a healing affect. So why don't we bring more nature into our lives?</p>
