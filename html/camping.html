        <p> The natural landscape is more natural to look at than the square angles of the city. Your eyes are round and are meant to look at curving shapes and naturally chaotic landscapes.
            The longer you spend in this natural environment the more refreshed and alive you will likely feel. The exercise will likely renew your body with strength and natural vitality. </p>
